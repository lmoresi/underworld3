  - **NS_Benchmark_DFG_2.png**: this is the benchmark for Reynolds number 100 in which the flow is a periodic shedding of vortices. 
    This figure shows the flow and flow markers two periods apart in a low resolution calculation. In the upper image of this figure, the vortex that is just being
    shed from the top side of the cylinder is just about to be swept out of the domain in the lower image. UW is clearly capturing the
    periodicity well but the benchmark also demands accurate computation of lift, drag, pressure, frequency etc.
