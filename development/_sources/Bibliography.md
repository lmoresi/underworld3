# Bibliography

<!-- This builds the bibliography itself when jupyter-book runs 
     However, this will be only the examples that are cited using the JB mechanisms and not references that might be in the code that we want here for completeness
     
     We therefore have an additional step: we have a cite-everything file that is included (quietly) at the end of this file. See CiteEveryReference.md for instructions 
     
     It's optional, of course.
